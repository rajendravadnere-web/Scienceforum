<h2>Science Forum Nashik</h2>
An informal body in the name of “Science Forum Nashik” has been acting since 1978 and conducting various programs, (like lectures by scientists, Hobby Classes during vacation of school children, workshops for teachers and competitions making video clips showing activity-based learning activities for school children) for advancement of the cause of developing scientific temper, creating awareness and developing interest in the young minds and in the public in general, a need for registering the body under Association of Persons was realised by the members of the above-mentioned informal body to address to the various legal, financial and administrative issues.
